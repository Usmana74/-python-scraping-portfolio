    "description": "<p><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">Who We Are:</b></p><p>Ethena Labs is at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi, dedicated to building products for modern finance. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money, USDe, alongside a globally accessible dollar savings asset, sUSDe.</p><p><br></p><p>Our core mission is to provide truly crypto-native financial solutions that are globally accessible and bridge the gap between TradFi and the digital asset economy. We believe in transparency, efficiency, and empowering both individuals and institutions with greater control over their assets.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">What we are Doing:</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking products designed to address key challenges and unlock new opportunities within the digital finance landscape.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Our flagship product, </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">USDe</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets, and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedging strategy to maintain its peg. This provides a truly scalable and censorship-resistant digital dollar.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Building upon USDe, we offer </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">sUSDe</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">. sUSDe provides crypto-native rewards generated from funding rates in derivatives markets, offering an alternative to existing products tethered to the traditional financial system.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Furthermore, we are actively developing solutions to facilitate institutional adoption of digital assets. In partnership with Securitize and Blackrocks BUIDL fund, </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">USDtb</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> provides a more traditional, asset-backed stablecoin option, leveraging established financial infrastructure to appeal to institutional clients. Expanding on this, </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">iUSDe</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> is designed specifically for traditional financial institutions, incorporating necessary compliance features to enable them to access the crypto-native rewards our protocol generates, in an institutional-friendly manner.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Finally, our most ambitious undertaking to date is </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Converge,</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> our joint blockchain initiative with Securitize. This hybrid blockchain is designed to be the nexus where DeFi meets the needs of CeFi and TradFi. Converge aims to be a primary issuance layer for tokenised assets, integrating seamlessly with existing DeFi protocols to provide institutions with an environment to participate in the decentralised economy.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open, efficient, and interconnected global financial system.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Join us!!</span></p><p><br></p><p><b><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The Role&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><br></p><p>The Compliance Operations Specialist will be a key supporting member of Ethena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance function, working directly with the Compliance Manager to ensure our internal processes scale efficiently and meet evolving regulatory and partner expectations.

With Tinybird, you can effortlessly ingest multiple data sources at scale, query and shape it using the 100% pure SQL you already know and love, and publish results as low-latency, high-concurrency APIs for your applications to chirp about. Developers can create fast APIs, faster\u00e2\u0080\u0094what used to take hours and days now only takes minutes! Tinybird is the essential tool that data engineers and software developers have been waiting for enabling you to drive innovation with ease.</p>\\n<p></p><p><br></p><b>What you will be doing: We are looking for someone to help us scale and to keep our software and infrastructure reliable and elastic as we scale. Someone who knows how to make hardware and software play together, and that participate as part of the oncall team, to understand not only our product, but also the issues our clients face.</b><ul><li>\u00e2\u0080\u008dWe run our stack in Linux. We try to keep things simple. Technologies we use:</li><li>OpenResty: SSL termination and load balancing</li><li>Varnish: load balancing and, sometimes, caching</li><li>Redis: metadata store</li><li>Python: most of our backend uses Python except some small bits that rely on C++ for hot paths</li><li>ClickHouse: our main data store</li><li>Zookeeper: for ClickHouse replicas coordination</li><li>We use Grafana, Loki and Mimir for monitoring and alerting</li><li>Terraform: Cloud provisioning (virtual machines, networks, Kubernetes clusters)</li><li>Ansible: Deploys and software and config provisioning</li><li>Our number of machines is still manageable, but the number keeps growing as we keep adding customers. This is not about managing infrastructure but about making sure that our software uses the hardware resources wisely and flexibly. This means you will not only have to worry about automating machines, but about helping the product team to design and develop the architecture of the system as a whole. That will require you to work with our backend code and to understand how ClickHouse works.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Some challenges and things we want to improve:</b></li><li>High-availability and elasticity: as we keep adding customers, we need to architect our system to be more efficient and flexible</li><li>Observability: from specific resource usage to a bird's eye view of the whole platform. This requires good knowledge of storage, networking, and computing</li><li>Disaster recovery: improving our tooling to manage and discover problems, but also improving our on-call procedures</li><li>As a specific challenge: when our customers grow, we need to upgrade their accounts. Now, we do it manually\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in the traditional sense of manual because we have tools that automate much of the process, but we need to take care of that one customer at a time: deciding what machines we need to spin-up, how much compute capacity we will provision, etc. Ideally, our architecture should allow our customers to upgrade themselves and assign more resources to them dynamically and seamlessly in the most dynamic, safe and transparent way possible.</li></ul><p><br></p><b>What you bring:</b><ul><li>Experience designing, building and running distributed Cloud architectures and large scale web based applications. That is, in so many words, what you will be responsible for at Tinybird</li><li>Programming skills and willingness to dive into our codebase, ClickHouse source code, or any other software we use in order to figure out how things work.
